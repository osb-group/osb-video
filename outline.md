# Outline

## Introduction
I hope you like brainstorming, because I sure do! Our goals are to:

* Decide on the most important topics to cover. What should we consider as a whole start-to-finish, and everything in between?
* Open up ideas to not only the main course, but also a side-curriculum of auxiliary effects. (A Main Quest and Side Quest?)
* Can we split things up properly that will convey a good video that a beginner can follow and learn? Khan Academy up this!

Let's start!

# The Most Important Content
Outline of outlines. These are all the specific topics that *should* be covered, but unsure of the correct interweaving and ordering yet. Multiple topics (aside from the Major Topics) will be paired with each other in some way.

## On the Problem of Programming
Specifically related to programming.

### Major Topics
1. Variables and Types
2. Decision Making
3. Loops
4. Arrays and Lists
5. Methods
6. Classes and Object-Oriented Programming

### Auxiliary, Minor Topics
1. Enumeration
2. Trigonometry and Math
3. LINQ Queries
4. System.Drawing
5. Data Structures: Stacks and Queues
6. Recursion
7. Data Structures: Trees
8. File I/O
9. Data Structures: Graphs
10. Data Structures: Spatial Data Structures

## On the Problem of Storyboarding
Storyboarding problems. While it is a bit generalized, its main focus is on Damnae's effective program, storybrew.

1. Objects and Layers
2. Telling Sprites What To Do: Properties of Sprites
3. Querying Sprite State
4. Easing
5. Particles
6. Lyrics
7. Sprite Pools
8. Parsing and Utilizing a Beatmap and its Hitobjects
9. Spectrums
10. Keyframes
11. Resource Management and Optimization

## On the Problem of Principles
Because these principles are brownie points in actually being a competent programmer in the future.

1. Modular Programming
2. DRY Princple: Don't Repeat Yourself
3. Big O: Algorithm Analysis and Efficiency
4. Readability and Clean Code
5. Planning Ahead

# Videos Outline
With the major topics out of the way, it's time to begin drafting some good organization between some of these topics. The more we can hit, the better! Each numerical point should be about a video's worth of content. Please note that this is not the actual outline of the video, but just the main topics covered. In other words, the topics inside each video section are not necessarily in chronological order.

## The Main Story
This is the intended curriculum and topics covered for the main videos. Later videos assume a cumulative knowledge of the content, so referencing the past topics are fair game.

1. Prologue
    - A (Brief) Explanation of Storyboarding
    - A (Brief) History of Storyboarding
    - Tools Available
        - Scripting
        - Design Editor
        - SGL (Deprecated)
        - Storybrew
        - osbpy
